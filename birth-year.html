    <h2 class="page-intro">
      Have you ever wondered how art has evolved over the years? How historical events may have influenced the artworks created in a specific year? What about the year you were born?
    </h2>
    <p class="intro-description">
      This tool invites you to explore pieces completed in the year of your birthâ€”and if you have a curious spirit and a critical mind, you might even start to notice patterns or uncover the stories behind the art of that time. Whether you're exploring your birth year or any other moment in history, this is your first step into discovering how art reflects the world around it.
